# What is 
A Unity Bluetooth Library for Windows and Embedded Systems communication. This is designed to making Bluetooth super easy to add to any project.

# Why
With all the upcoming untethered VR and AR expereinces, we wanted to help create a way to help make bluetooth an easy integration for anyone. As of now, the main Bluetooth support in Unity is only for Android/iOS development. Windows has a very low support. Bluetooth 5.0 is going to be a huge improvement with its 48MBps speed and 800 Feet range. We are hoping to be the go-to source for all future Unity to embedded systems projects.

# How to use

**We are currently writing high quality steps and packaging up all the many parts to allow for easy intergration**

## Unity Packages

## Python Package

Requires `pybluez` and bluetooth developmental headers
(`libbluetooth-dev`).

User Installation:

`pip install src/Python` from the root directory of the repository.

## C Packages
